# Rex Language Spec (Current Implementation and v1 Baseline)

This document describes the implementation that exists in this repository today and
the baseline Rex intends to carry into `1.0` unless changed explicitly before the freeze.
It follows compiler and runtime behavior first, and only states rules we can point to in code.

## 1. Design Direction

Rex aims to be:
- Simple to read and write
- Fast to compile
- Strong on correctness checks (types, ownership, borrows)
- Practical for systems-style tasks with a compact runtime

The current compiler pipeline is:

1. Lexer (tokenization)
2. Parser (AST construction)
3. Typechecker (types, ownership, bond rules)
4. C code generation
5. Native compilation with your C compiler

## 2. Program Structure

A Rex program is a list of items and statements.

Top-level items:
- `use` imports
- `fn` functions
- `struct` definitions
- `enum` definitions
- `impl` method blocks
- `type` aliases

Example:

```rex
use rex::io

struct Point { x: f64, y: f64 }

impl Point {
    fn len(&self) -> f64 {
        return sqrt(self.x * self.x + self.y * self.y)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 3, y: 4 }
    println(p.len())
}
```

## 3. Type System

Rex supports:
- Numeric types (all numeric names map to numeric behavior)
- `bool`, `str`, `nil`
- Struct and enum types
- Tuples
- References: `&T`, `&mut T`
- Pointers: `*T`
- Containers: `Vec<T>`, `Map<K, V>`, `Set<T>`
- Channels: `Sender<T>`, `Receiver<T>`
- `Result<T, E>` (with `E` defaulting to `str` when omitted)

Type annotations are optional in many places, but recommended at boundaries.

## 4. Ownership and Borrowing

Rex performs ownership checks in the typechecker:
- Non-copy values are moved on use
- Copy-like values can be reused
- Immutable and mutable borrows are tracked
- Invalid aliasing patterns are rejected
- Some reference lifetime mistakes are rejected (outliving checks)

The ownership model is documented in detail in `docs/ownership.md`.

## 5. Control Flow

Supported flow constructs:
- `if` / `else`
- `while`
- `for` range loops (`for i in a..b`)
- `for` over vectors (`for x in vec`)
- `match` for enums and `Result`
- `return`, `break`, `continue`
- `defer`

`match` arms support:
- a single tag, optionally with a binding (`Some(x) => ...`)
- multiple tags in one arm (`A | B => ...`)
- a wildcard fallback arm (`_ => ...`)

Assignment forms supported today include:
- direct assignment (`x = value`)
- compound assignment (`x += value`, etc.)
- member assignment (`obj.field = value`)
- index assignment (`v[i] = value`)
- nested mixed paths such as `items[0].value += 1`

Struct values can be created through either constructor calls (`Type.new(...)`)
or named-field literals (`Type { field: value }`).

## 6. Error Handling

Rex uses `Result` values and supports:
- `Ok(value)`
- `Err(error)`
- `expr?` to propagate errors

`?` is lowered into generated control flow that returns early on `Err`.

## 7. Bond System

Rex includes transaction-like scoped operations:
- `bond name = value`
- mutate state
- `commit` to keep changes
- `rollback` to undo tracked changes

Current rollback tracks and undoes:
- variable assignment
- struct member assignment
- index assignment

See `docs/bonds_system.md` for full details and examples.

## 8. Concurrency Model

Rex supports:
- `spawn { ... }`
- channel creation and message passing
- waiting for spawned work in runtime

Basic pattern:

```rex
use rex::thread as th

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = th.channel<i32>()
    spawn { tx.send(7) }
    println(rx.recv())
}
```

## 9. Runtime and Platform Notes

The generated C uses `rex/runtime_c`.

Platform notes:
- UI backend:
  - Windows: Win32
  - Linux: X11
  - macOS: Cocoa
- HTTPS:
  - Windows: WinHTTP
  - Linux/macOS: OpenSSL (`libssl`, `libcrypto`)

## 10. Stability Notes

Rex is actively maintained and used across the examples in this repository.
For `1.0`, Rex is prioritizing a stable language/tooling contract over large syntax growth.

Current stability baseline:
- keep the language explicit, keyword-first, and inspectable
- keep project/package workflows small and predictable
- treat `rex.toml` `version` as the app/package version, separate from the Rex CLI release version
- freeze documented package limitations deliberately instead of leaving them ambiguous

For `1.0` gates and accepted limitations, see `docs/roadmap.md` and `docs/package-manager-v1.md`.
